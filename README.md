# Calendar Maker
Yet another calendar maker... with random photo feature

Do you have hundreds, thousands of photos?
Not much of use of them, but still like them and browsing them from time to time?
Do you use week/month paper calendar?
Are you rather staying offline?

Then this is application for you!

Select folder, or set of folders or folder of folders, and generate your table 'A' like or hang-to-wall calendar.
You can select from week view or month view. And can select position of photo.
The photos are generated automatically, but before final print you can regenerate or select pictures you do not like.

You can provide an important dates - like birthdays, anniversaries - and the days of theirs are then highlighted in calendar
If you select to use name days, you can pick up few names, and those will be highlighted

Optional phases of moon or huge numbers for weakening eyesight are included

Currently only Monday is supported as start of week (Sunday is already implemented but missing in gui)

During work, you can select another Random picture, another random picture from same Folder, You can ump to Next, Previous or Select exact one. You can rotate, undo and redo changes. You can move picture to next, previous page.
!!! What you see is what you get. But remember, that once you squeeze to PDF, the ratios may change bit, so check that, and if they changed a bit, adjust working window as necessary !!!

Of course you can save your work.

Export options to PDF. Currently only A4 is supported, but others are implemented and just missing in gui.
 - as single page per calendar page.
 - "A" like for single side printing
 - "A" like for double side side printing

Once you are done printing, you can bind the "as single page per calendar page." as it is.
The "A" calendars gave two pages on one side of paper. you can impale it as it is and use. However recommended is to cut each page in half, and then bind. 
*Do* *not* mess an order of pages in case of "A" calendars. Believe that, and trust that they were indeed printed in correct order, and are ready (to be cut and) to be used directly.
